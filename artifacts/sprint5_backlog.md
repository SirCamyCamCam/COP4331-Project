|----|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|-------|
| 001 | As a player, I would like the Ants to have the ability to stay idle at a Waypoint | 8 | 2 | Given the Ants have an idle, they stay within 5 meters of the Waypoint when in the "Idle" state | Cameron |
| 002 | As a player, I would like to have 1 queen per nursery | 2 | 2 | There may only be as many queens as there are nursery waypoints | To Do |
| 003 | As a player, I would like the forager to travel to and from the leaf and farm site | 10 | 1 | Given the forager ant's job is collect leaves, when it collects a leaf an places it in the farm, then it's job is complete | To Do |
| 004 | As a player, I would like to see the path of travel for ants | 3 | 2 | Given the colony may expand, when the player creates a new waypoint, then there must be a line between the waypoints | Cameron |
