# Product Vision

For the gamers, real time strategistâ€™s and the general public, this game caters to those looking to pass time with a strategy game and improve critical thinking and analytical skills. The product is a strategy game called Coloniant, which educates players on the inner workings of an ant colony and promotes quick thinking and problem solving. Unlike other strategy games like Cities Skylines, our game requires meticulous planning of the correct ant population in order to maintain the health of the colony. Our product offers a fun and educational game which allows the user to learn in an unobtrusive manner while still maintaining an addictive and enjoyable experience. The game can be enjoyed by casual and seasoned gamers alike.

As the player you will be tasked to manage a leaf cutter ant colony. By managing the population of different types of ants, you will be able to maintain a healthy colony. There are 6 categories of ants as listed:
1. Queen - Tasked with laying eggs for selected ant types chosen by the player
2. Solider - Able to protect the colony from foreign colony invasions and other insects munching on your colony 
3. Foragers- Collects leaves from the outside world and leaves them to be farmed by the Gardener ant 
4. Gardener - Farms said leaves for fungus which is the Leaf Cutter ant's main source of  food 
5. Trash Handlers - Removes dead ants and mold which grows from un maintained leaves 
6. Excavators - Creates "roads" and rooms for the colony which allow for movement through the colony

There are 5 objectives. It will be the responsibility of the player to choose which of the 6 ants to spawn in order to keep all levels of the colony in check. 
1. Manage food - Managing the food is a critical task to keep your colony happy. Growth of fungus vs consumption rate is what the player must keep an eye on. Have too many ants, they starve and die. Have too much food and it is unmaintained and grows mold. 
2. Protect colony - The defense of your colony is with respect to the soldier ant to total ant ratio. The bigger the colony, the more solider ants you need. If you have too few you get raided and have large losses in population. Have too many soldier ants and you might not have enough food as they require most food
3. Manage trash - Dead ants increase mold growth and reduce rate of flow on roads. Trash areas fill up and you need to excavate more space over time. 
4. Manage space/roads - Not enough room in your colony and you can't lay enough eggs or grow enough fungus. If the roads aren't big enough then you have slowed movement and reduced productivity. 
5. Manage populations - Having not enough or too many of one ant can negatively impact your progress. This is the player's main way to keep the colony happy and healthy and progress over time.

Ants do not have a long lifespan and will sacarfice themselves for the greater good of the colony. It is the player's task to keep and eye out on which populations are dying off and be able to replace them as needed.
