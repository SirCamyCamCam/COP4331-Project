# Product Vision

For the gamers, real time strategistâ€™s and the general public, this game caters to those looking to pass time with a strategy game and improve critical thinking and analytical skills. The product is a strategy game called Coloniant, which educates players on the inner workings of an ant colony and promotes quick thinking and problem solving. Unlike other strategy games like Cities Skylines, our game requires meticulous planning of the correct ant population in order to maintain the health of the colony. Our product offers a fun and educational game which allows the user to learn in an unobtrusive manner while still maintaining an addictive and enjoyable experience. The game can be enjoyed by casual and seasoned gamers alike.
